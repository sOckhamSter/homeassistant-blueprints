- IOG_GivEnergy_Inverter_Control_Simplified.yaml:<br />
A simplified version of the above blueprint which will only work with the BottlecapDave Octopus Energy integration and select chargers / vehicles. Requires the Intelligent Dispatching sensor to toggle on whenever you are getting an off-peak rate, and off when it reverts back to peak. It must not only toggle when the car is actively charging. More reliable and responsive than the full fat version but not as generically suitable for all scenarios.
